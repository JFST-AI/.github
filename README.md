# JFST-AI ∞

**One product. One baseline. No drift.**

## Start here
- Main iOS app (V1 baseline): TBD
- Prompt system (registry + prompt-proof): TBD
- Guardrails (proof runner + org rules): TBD

## Non-negotiables
- `main` stays green + protected
- Every drift bug becomes a contract (test/validator)
- PRs must show Proof + Evidence
